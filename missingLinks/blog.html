            <b>Scenic Liechtenstein</b><br>
            The train from Innsbruck to Zurich was very interesting. The route took us through Liechtenstein, a very charming little country nestled between Austria and Switzerland that I was looking forward to seeing. By the time I realized we were no longer in Austria, however, the train had already crossed over into Switzerland.
