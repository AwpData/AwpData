  <h1>Whale Shark</h1>
  <p>
    A whale shark (<i>Rhincodon Typus</i>) is considered one of the <b>largest fish</b> in the world!
    <br />
    They love warm climates which is why they live in tropical oceans around Central America and South America.
    <br />
    Whale sharks can live up to 100 years old!
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>FUN FACT:</b> Whale sharks feed on plankton as their throats are the size of quarters!
